                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p><strong>An intelligent and innovative application for your nutrition label.</strong></p>
                <p>We are the Nutria team, formed by 8 dedicated students from the <a
                        href="https://institutojef.org.br/" target="_blank">Instituto J&F</a>, united by a common
                    purpose:
                    to make a difference through innovation. The team emerged from a challenge proposed by <a
                        href="https://www.jbs.com.br/" target="_blank">JBS</a>,
                    within our interdisciplinary project, where we were encouraged to develop and solve real problems
                    faced by industries in the state of São Paulo, with creativity and
                    commitment, contributing to both society and the industrial sector.
                    With different skills and perspectives, we work collaboratively, always seeking
                    balance between technology, sustainability, and social impact. We believe that good ideas gain
                    strength
                    when put into action by committed people — and that’s what drives every step of our project.</p>
                <img src="../assets/images/tela1.svg" alt="">
                <p>Nutria was created to solve the lack of a practical tool that automatically connects
                    ingredients and their quantities to a nutrition label — and vice versa — through a smart, practical,
                    and innovative technological solution.</p>

        <!-- MAIN GOAL -->
        <section class="main-goal">
            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>The main objective of the platform is to automate and simplify a process that is still largely
                manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors: the creation and adjustment of nutrition labels as required
                by
                ANVISA regulations.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/tela2.svg" alt="Nutria application">
            <p>By offering a tool that automatically connects ingredients and their quantities to the corresponding
                nutritional information — and also does the reverse, from the label to the estimation of ingredients —
                Nutria aims to provide speed, accuracy, and safety.</p>
            <p>This represents a significant advancement for the food industry, which faces the challenge of meeting
                strict regulations,
                such as RDC nº 429/2020 and IN nº 75/2020, while also seeking innovation, cost reduction, and greater
                efficiency in product development.</p>
